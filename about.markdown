I'm a designer at [Oak](https://oak.is) in Brooklyn, NY. Check out my [home page](http://justinjay.wang).

On this blog you can find experiments and such. I talk about it here in the [preface](/2017/preface/).

This site runs on [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/) and is set in [Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono).
