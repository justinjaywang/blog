*Be more open*.

I have a lot of love to share.

A number of things have happened to me growing up that caused me to be more reserved. I wasn't always like this, and I don't think it's my true nature.

Fear of rejection. I'm happy with who I am.

Past resolutions:

- *Focus* (2016)
- *Take action* (2015)
- *Stay inspired* (2014)
- *Go with the flow* (2012)
- *Connect with people more* (2011)
