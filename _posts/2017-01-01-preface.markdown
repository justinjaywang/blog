I kept a previous blog, [Journal](http://journal.justinjay.wang/), from 2012–2016. It served its purpose well. It trained me to write, and therefore think, better. But its format was too restrictive. I was stuck keeping a certain photo style and formal tone.

I see it as representing one phase of my style as a designer. It was too calculated and perfect. Here, I'm pushing for capricious and prolific.

I want to use this as a space for creative exploration. Its format is better suited for a wide variety of content: graphics, illustrations, photo experiments, charts, GIFs, videos, code snippets, and crappy iPhone photos that otherwise wouldn't have made the cut. Less of a daily log, more of a digital scrapbook. I hope you enjoy!
