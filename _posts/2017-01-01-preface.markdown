I kept a previous blog, [Journal](http://journal.justinjay.wang/), from 2012â€“2016. It served its purpose well. It trained me to write, and therefore, think, better. But its format was too restrictive. I was stuck using the same photo style and formal tone.

That journal represented one phase of my evolution as a designer (and maybe person, too). It was calculated and perfect. I'm pushing for capricious and prolific.

I want to use this as a space for creative exploration, with a focus on original work: graphics, illustrations, photo experiments, charts, GIFs, videos, code snippets, whatever. Less of a daily log, more of a digital scrapbook. Enjoy :)
