*Be more open*. I'm resolving to open myself up to new people and new experiences, and not being afraid to show my personality.

Looking back, I think a number of things have happened in my life where I slowly became more reserved, for fear of rejection. I wasn't always this way, and I don't think it's my true nature.

I have a lot of love to give. Here's to sharing more of it from here on out.
